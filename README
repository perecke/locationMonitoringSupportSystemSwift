This is a GPS monitoring support application which was made for people who would like to remember things or activities based on their location. 
The user can add new pin to the map by a long touch gesture, when a category list appears (shopping, medicine and meeting) the user chooses
the category and based on the category a new list with previously added elements appear. 

To store the previous data as markers and as texts I used CoreData.
When the user gets close to a certain marker the device detects the location and sends the notification to a user as a message and a sound.
The user can add new elements to the category list and can also delete them by swiping right. 
The markers and pins can be also deleted by pressing the Del button on the marker.

FUTURE PLAN
-Add more categories
-Access item database to make a better list
-Acces Facebook friend list and update the tableview according to that
-Add rout desing support
